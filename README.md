# Redis-Experiment
This is to practise redis, in order to understand it better. Because right now, I am still somewhat confuse. I believe a very simple project will help to clear the confusion. Then I can implement redis on my capstone project.

P.S.
After so much effort spanning 2 days, several iterations and countless hours (about 20hrs) slaving over documentations, youtube videos and such, Redis has finally began to make sense to me small, small! ðŸ¤£ 
I now better understand the concept of caching. And I know that as I continue to work on projects, my proficiency will improve
